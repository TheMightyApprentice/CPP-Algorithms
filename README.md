# CPP-Algorithms

This program allows a user to insert a directed or undirected graph and use BFS, DFS, Prim's, and Dijkstra's on said graph.

-Undirected or directed will be asked by the program first.

--The program in its current state will ask for a number of nodes which should be entered as one less than the actual number of nodes (the number zero is included since an array is used).

--Also, as the vertices are dealt with by an array, ensure that the vertice numbers do not go over the number entered above.

-After that, enter the edges and the strings corresponding with the vertices as new edges are added.

-For the current moment, use the beginning of the graph as the start point for the algorithms.

-In regards to the numbers that occur after the Dijkstra's inputs, the top row is a representation of the nodes in an array and records the cost that it took to go to that vertice (or the current cost if the algorithm is still looking for a cheaper route to said vertice) and the bottom row covers which vertices have not been encountered by the alogrithm at the given step.
